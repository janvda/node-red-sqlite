# node-red-sqlite

The `janvda/node-red-sqlite` images on docker hub are based on the official node-red images (`nodered/node-red`) with **sqlite** functionality already embedded within it.

## Rationale

The main advantage is to save time when developing/building a node-red application that uses an sqlite DB.

FYI building these images for the `linux/arm/v7` architecture takes about 20 minutes !
